## How to Apply

### For Windows Terminal.

Open settings.json and copy color scheme code in it and set scheme name.<br>

NOTE - Use this scheme only for Wsl with Zsh shell, using this scheme with Cmd/Powershell is not gonna make much difference.

### For VS Code Terminal.

Open settings.json of terminal from settings and paste color scheme code.<br>

NOTE - This terminal theme is independent of your editor color scheme.
